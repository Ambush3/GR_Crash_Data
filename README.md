Using the CGR_CRASH_DATA.csv from https://grdata-grandrapids.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/grandrapids::cgr-crash-data/about   
I was able to go through and narrow down data from what type of accidents were happening the most, what sex had more alcohol induced crashes, 
what years had the most accidents, speedlimit at which the accident occured, and what roads had the most accidents, and so on.
